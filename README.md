# **Pixel Sorting Algorithm Visualizer Application**
## A program that helps the user to better understand the sorting algorithms
###### So far only bubble sort is available

## How does it work:
- Program opens up an interface with the selected pre-shuffled picture 
- The program sorting the pixels back in the initial order using one of the preselected sorting algorithms
- The picture is being shuffled from the bottom to the top


## How to use the program:
1. Open this folder: Pixel-Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer/src/sorting/visualizer/
2. Open the Display.java file with your code editor.
3. On line 35 enter the path to the picture you would like to would want to use as a sorting example
4. On the line 144 change the integer value (3rd value you passing to the sort value)
 - The higher the value the faster it will sort the pixels 
 - You can always change the value depending on your CPU and graphics card  
5. Run the program

**Recommendation**: Don't use a photo with a high dimension unless you have a powerful computer. It will eat the FPS. You can keep the track of the FPS at the title of the program
